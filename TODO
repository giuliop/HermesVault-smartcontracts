* check MBR increase == 15_300
* make the arc4 signatures in TSS.py automatically inserted


Tests
* test withdrawing to an algorand address bigger than modulus (will probably need to take the modulus first before adding to public inputs since the verifires expects public inputs to be in the curve field but an Algorand address might represent a number larger than the field modulus)
* test using a dummy lsig instead of the correct verifier
* test having proper lsig as sender but no signer
* test call to `validate_manager` with logicsig signer and manager sender
* test extra_txn_fee for withdrawals
